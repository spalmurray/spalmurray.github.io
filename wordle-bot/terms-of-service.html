            <b>By participating in a Discord server that has invited wordle-bot, you accept and agree to the terms outlined in this document and those in the Privacy Policy. If you do not accept or do not agree to these terms, then please do not participate in a Discord server that has invited wordle-bot.</b>

            In this document, ‘wordle-bot’ refers specifically to the Discord API client deployed by me, Spencer Murray (also known as spalmurray), on the Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud instance that I rent and operate. While the source code for wordle-bot is available on GitHub under an MIT Licence, this is not what I am referring to here as ‘wordle-bot’ and I will take no responsibility for any harm caused by another Discord API client deployment derived from this source code, as I can only verify the integrity of and thus be reasonably held accountable for the specific deployment that I oversee.
        </p>
        <p className="tos">
            While wordle-bot is related to and intended to be used along side the word game, Wordle, it is in no way associated with Wordle’s creator, Josh Wardle (also known as powerlanguage), nor the owner of Wordle, The New York Times, and neither party should be held accountable for any issues that may arise from wordle-bot.
        </p>
        <p className="tos">
            wordle-bot is provided free-of-charge, but I may accept donations for the purposes of funding server rental and supporting me, the creator.
        </p>
        <p className="tos">
            wordle-bot is provided for informational and recreational purposes only. I will take no responsibility for the availability or accuracy of any information accessible through wordle-bot’s Discord message interface. As such, I will take no responsibility for any error or harm resulting from the information being unavailable or inaccurate.
        </p>
        <p className="tos">
            I may terminate any user’s access to wordle-bot at any time without reason or notice. This may mean the deletion of all associated user data. I may also terminate the service as a whole at any time without reason or notice. In this instance, I will delete all user data within 30 days.
        </p>
        <p className="tos">
            I reserve the right to change these terms of service at any time as I see fit and a user’s continued participation in a Discord server that has invited wordle-bot indicates their continued acceptance and agreement to these terms. I may make changes without notifying users, so each user is responsible for returning here to read the terms regularly.
